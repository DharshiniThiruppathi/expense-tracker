# Company expense-tracker
The Company Expense Tracker Website is a web-based application designed to simplify and automate expense management within an organization. It allows employees (users) to submit their daily expenses with details such as title, category, date, and amount, while administrators can monitor, approve, or reject these expenses in real time.

The system provides role-based dashboards for users and admins, advanced search, filtering, sorting, pagination, and detailed expense reports. With a clean interface and structured workflow, the application reduces manual effort, improves transparency, and ensures accurate expense tracking for companies.
